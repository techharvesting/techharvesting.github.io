If you have watched any other tutorials/posts like this, you know, that we use a package called `ohmyzsh`, but that slows down the shell a bit, so we will do it without `ohmyzsh`! Just normal `zsh`! (We will use a theme called `powerlevel10k`)


## Step 1: Install `zsh`
Now, most of Linux distributions come Pre Installed with `bash`, which is a shell, but we will use `zsh` in this tutorial <br /> <br />
So to install zsh on `Ubuntu/Debian/Raspbian/Mint/Pop/Any debian based distro` run: 
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install zsh
```
Next run `zsh` on the command line to test if the installation worked
If it did, you are ready for the next step üéä
 else *troubleshoot* the install üòï

## Step 2: Changing the default shell
Open up a new terminal and Bash will popup...
Let us make `zsh` the default üòé

To Change the default shell, run: 
```bash
chsh
```
and when prompted, enter `/bin/zsh` as the shell

Now, open a new session, and boom there is `zsh`... still ugly though

## Step 3: Style it up ü§©
### Let us now install our theme `powerlevel10k`

First you can install a recomended font... mostly a `nerd font` (Link to repo below) I use a font called `VictorMono NF` (also linked below)

Run: 
```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ~/powerlevel10k
echo 'source ~/powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k.zsh-theme' >>~/.zshrc
```
This installs `powerlevel10k`, When you open up a new session, you get a config wizard:

Answer the question to your liking and then use your new **better** terminal!

**And we did not use Ohmyzsh**

So how did you do it?
