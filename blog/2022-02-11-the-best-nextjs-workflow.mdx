## The best next.js workflow with Typescript, sass and more!


 Do you use Next.js? then make sure you use these tools to boost your productivity and development experience!

## Typescript

> Typescript is a very popular and good choice for using with Next.js or any other framework ! It is going to reduce the amount of errors we get by introducing a type system with JavaScript

To Create a Next.js project with **typescript** , run:
```bash
npx create-next-app next-typescript-app --ts
```

This will create a next.js project with typescript support and also a `tsconfig.json` file (the **typescript configuration** file)

## Sass

> **Sass** is an awesome superset for css which supports a lot of features like nesting , `if` conditions and more. You can learn more about sass [here](https://sass-lang.com/documentation) 

It is very simple to add `sass` to your project if you use next.js. Just add sass with
```bash npm2yarn
npm install sass
```

Then rename your `.css` files with `.scss` or `.sass` extensions. If you use the `.sass` extension, when you will have to **remove** the curly braces and the semicolons. Or you can use the `.scss` extension. You can also rename the css module files with the `.sass` or the `.scss` extension

## Prettier

> Does your code not get formatted the way you want? use Prettier! prettier is a code formatter which is also very popular you can learn more about prettier  [here](https://prettier.io/) 

To add prettier to your project, run:
```bash npm2yarn
npm install prettier -D
```

I also create a npm script in my `package.json` to format my code. ( I named it *clean*)

```json
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint",
    "clean": "prettier --write ."
  }
```
So now when you run `npm run clean` of `yarn clean` you will see that your code gets clean. I also create a `.prettierrc` file in the root of my project and give the following in it:

```json
{
  "singleQuote": true
}
```
But if you look carefully, then you will find you that it also format the files in our `.next` folder created by next.js, so to *ignore* the files in the `.next` folder, create a `.prettierignore` file at the root of your project with the following contents
```sh
# next.js dev server files
.next/
# npm packages
node_modules/
```

## Using husky to format code

 <h1><font size='100'>🐶</font></h1>

I did not find a logo for husky 🤷‍♂️

> If you use git, this will be super useful! you can create a git hook, which will format our code before each commit.

Since we have prettier already installed, run:
```sh
npx mrm@2 lint-staged
```
We are also using husky in here. so it will create a `.husky` folder

And in our `package.json`, in the `lint-staged` section, change to the following if using typescript
```json
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.ts": "eslint --cache --fix",
    "*.{tsx,.ts,css,md}": "prettier --write"
  }
```

Now, I did a quick commit with
```bash
git commit -m '🦋 Formatting with Prettier'
```
and.....   Our code is pretty as we specified in our `.prettierrc` file

## Testing 🧪

> If you want to test your next.js application, use `cypress` as shown in the next.js  [docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/testing) 

Install cypress by running:
```bash npm2yarn
npm install -D cypress
```

:::tip

Cypress is used for **end to end testing** of your next.js application.

:::

Create a cypress script
```json
"test": "cypress open"
```

Run cypress with
```bash npm2yarn
npm run test
```

You can create your tests now ( I am not showing anything now). You can learn more  [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/testing) 

That was it! You can of course add on to this list...
**Thanks for reading** 😁
