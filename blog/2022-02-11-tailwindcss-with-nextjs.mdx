> Tailwind css is Super Awesome. It is my favorite CSS Framework.
> This post is all about setting it up with Next.js (My Favorite JavaScript framework)

# The Shorter way

If you have not yet created a next.js project, then use this command to set it up with tailwind preconfigured for you!

```bash
npx create-next-app -e with-tailwindcss next-tailwind
```

Then Change your directory:

```bash
cd next-tailwind
```

And start the server:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

# The Second Approach

If you have already got a project, it still is simple!

First install a _few_ dependencies:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install -D tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest
```

This should install tailwind, postcss and autoprefixer

Next, Get generate your configuration for Tailwind and Postcss.

```bash
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Then, import it in your `pages/_app.js` file

```jsx
import 'tailwindcss/tailwind.css';
```

Finally, Run your server

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

That was all you needed to do to have tailwind in your project. If you apply a class now, it will reflect on the webpage.
